This package contains an export to PDF feature for CKEditor 5. It allows you to generate a PDF file directly from the CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor content.

When enabled, this feature sends the content of your editor together with the styles that are used to display it to the CKEditor Cloud Services HTML to PDF converter service. The service then generates a PDF document that can be downloaded by the user. This allows you to easily print your content to the PDF format.
